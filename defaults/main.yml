# most other settings have their defaults but allowing overriding if desired.
# to do this just prefix the configuration property with `pgbouncer_`.
# be careful to use the right variable type and check templates/pgbouncer.ini.j2
# to make sure your setting is available for overriding.

# some example dynamic overrides:
# pool sizes
#pgbouncer_max_client_conn: 100
#pgbouncer_default_pool_size: 20
# listen port
#pgbouncer_listen_port: 5432
